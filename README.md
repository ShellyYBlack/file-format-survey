# File format survey
This script supports reporting of file format types in SCRC's born-digital collections. It combines Siegfried and FITS reports into a Dataframe, then calculates the total number of file formats. Results can be output to a CSV or data visualization.

1. Before running the script, edit the path in line 8 first. Change $HOME/sf_fits to the path where your reports are located.
2. Then run: `python3 file_format_analysis.py`
